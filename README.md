## About

OpenCore EFI Folder for the **Dell OptiPlex 5050 Micro Small Form Factor** Desktop with an Intel® Core™ i5-7500T. This model has no Wi-Fi/BT module (yet) – it's connected via LAN. I am basically using it as a streaming box connected to my TV via HDMI controlled via a Wireless Keyboard (Logitec 400k+). I get 4k resolution at 60 Hz in Windows – I can't seem to enable it in macOS, though (no LSPCON).

I've generated the base EFI folder with OpCore Simplify but I had to modify and tweak it a bit: 

- Added IRQ fixes so audio works 
- Added a proper framebufer patch so that on-bord graphics acceleration would work. 
- Added a modified DMAR table with stripped Reserved Memory Regions so that the `DisableIOMaper` quirk is not required and `AppleVTD` does work.

It's currently using the `iMac18,3` SMBIOS because that's the closest in terms of CPU specs. The `macmini8,3` SMBIOS uses an 8th Gen CPU, so it's not really suited for this system.

>[!NOTE]
>
> **WiFi**: I've tested Wi-Fi with a TP Link [Archer T2U Nano](https://www.tp-link.com/de/home-networking/adapter/archer-t2u-nano/) USB dongle and this [tool](https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-OC-Big-Sur-Adapter) in macOS Sonoma and Sequoia and it's working fine.

## What works?

### macOS (tested)

- [x] macOS Sequoia
- [x] macOS Sonoma

### Hardware

- [x] iGPU (Intel HD Graphics 630)
	- [x] HDMI 1.4 Port (`con0`)
	- [x] Display Port (`con1`)
	- [x] Display Port (`con2`)  
- [x] SATA Controller
- [x] USB 3.1 (XHCI)
- [x] Ethernet
- [x] Audio (Line-Out, Mic, Headphone, Built-in Speaker)

> [!NOTE]
>
> Display Port `con2` is an optional expansion not present on stock devices (Dell Micro_DP Upgrade A00 LX4038).
  
## Issues

- [ ] Black Screen on wake – displays won't turn on after exiting sleep. Adding the `force-online` property to the framebuffer patch didn't help. The workaround for now is to prohibit the display form turning off when the system is idle (see System Settings &rarr; Lock Screen)
- [ ] No 4k resolution in macOS (I either can't find the required LPSCON to enable 4K output or doesn't have one)

## BIOS Settings

- **General**
	- **Boot Sequence**: Add a path to the `OpenCore.efi` (Add Boot Option)
	- **UEFI Boot Path Security**: Never
- **System Configuration**
	- **Integrated NIC**
		- Enable Network Stack [x]
		- Enabled
	- **SATA Operation**: AHCI
	- **Drives**: Enable the Interfaces you want/need (SATA/M.2)
	- **USB Configuration**: enable the USB ports you want/need (no USB kext required, since it's within the 15 port Limit, defined as the correct types already)
- **Video**
	- Primary Display: Intel HD Graphics
- **Secure Boot**
	- Seucre Boot Enable: Disabled
- **Intel Software Guard Extension**
	- Intel SGX Enable: Disabled
- **Performance**
	- Multicore Support: All
	- Intel Speedstepp: Enable
	- C-States: Enable
	- Intel TurbBoost: enable
- **Power Management**
	- AC Recovery: Power Off
	- Disk Sleep Control: Enable S4 and S5
	- USB Wake Support: Enable
	- Wake on LAN/WLAN: Disabled
- **POST Behavior**
	- Fastboot: Thorough	 
- **Virtualization Support**
	- Enable Intel Virtualization Technology: enable if you want to use Hyper-V (Windows)
	- VT for Direct I/O: enable if you want to use Hyper-V (Windows)
- **Wireless**:
	-  WLAN/Wiig: if you have a WLAN card, enable it. 	-  Bluetooth: if you have a BT Card, enable it
- **Advanced Configurations**
	- ASPM: Auto

> [!NOTE]
> 
> If your Dell Optiplex has a WiFI/BT card you still have to add the required kexts and settings (and maybe OCLP root patches) to make it work! 

## Deployment
- Download the latest OC EFI folder from the [Releases](https://github.com/5T33Z0/Dell-Optiplex-5050-Micro-OpenCore/releases) section
- Extract it
- Open the config.plist with OCAT
- Select the PlatformInfo/Generic Section and Generate a Serial number
- Copy EFI to a FAT32 formtted USB flash drive
- Boot macOS from the USB flash drive
- If the folder works then copy it to your internal disk

## Post-Install

### Fixing Sleep issues

In order to prevent the most common issues with sleep, we will set it to `hibernatemode 0` (Suspend to RAM), write protect the slee pimage using Terminal:


```bash
sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo touch /var/vm/sleepimage
sudo chflags uchg /var/vm/sleepimage
```

Next, we disable `displaysleep` and `powernap` to workaround the black-screen-on-wake issue. And since this Mini-PC does not have a motion sensor, we also disable proximitywake: 

```bash 
sudo pmset displaysleep 0
sudo pmset powernap 0
sudo pmset proximitywake 0
```

### Disable Gatekeeper (optional)
I disable Gatekeeper on my systems because it is annoying and wants to stop you from running scripts from github etc. To do so, enter `sudo spctl --master-disable` in Terminal. Disabling Gatekeeper in macOS Sequoia requires a few more [steps](https://github.com/5T33Z0/OC-Little-Translated/blob/main/14_OCLP_Wintel/Guides/Disable_Gatekeeper.md).
